    <p>As a scientist, I believe that it is essential to make research accessible to a broader audience, including underrepresented and underserved communities. My outreach efforts focus on fostering curiosity, promoting inclusivity, and encouraging participation in evolutionary biology, regardless of background or experience.</p>
	<p>I am committed to bridging the gap between scientific research and the public by engaging in various outreach activities that promote scientific literacy and inclusivity. My experience includes participating in educational workshops, developing accessible research tools like 3D photogrammetry models for educational use, and providing mentorship to students from diverse backgrounds. By leveraging technology and creative approaches, I aim to make complex scientific concepts understandable and engaging for everyone.</p>
	<p>One of my ongoing goals is to use 3D modeling and photogrammetry in teaching and outreach. This allows individuals from all walks of life to experience the intricacies of evolutionary biology firsthand through interactive visual tools. I believe in the importance of democratizing science, ensuring that everyone, regardless of resources, has access to cutting-edge methodologies. This is reflected in my ongoing work to make photogrammetry pipelines and other research tools freely available through open-source platforms.</p>
	<p>In addition to my formal outreach efforts, I find personal fulfillment in sharing nature with children in the foster care system. I believe that nature can provide a calming and stabilizing influence, especially for children who may experience uncertainty in their home lives. While unofficial, I take opportunities to introduce these children to hiking and outdoor exploration, fostering a sense of curiosity and connection to the natural world.</p>
	<p>Through my outreach efforts, I aim to inspire the next generation of scientists, particularly those from underrepresented groups, and to highlight the importance of inclusivity in STEM. By fostering a culture of curiosity, creativity, and collaboration, I hope to show that science is not just for a few—it’s for everyone.
