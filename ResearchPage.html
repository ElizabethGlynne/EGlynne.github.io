            <div class="sectionContent">
				<p>I am currently a PhD candidate in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Iowa State University, working under the guidance of 
					<a href="https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/dcadams/" target="_blank">Dr. Dean C. Adams</a>. My research focuses on understanding the broad evolutionary processes that shape phenotypic diversity. My work explores key evolutionary concepts such as 
					<strong>sexual dimorphism</strong>, <strong>miniaturization</strong>, and <strong>morphological integration</strong>, aiming to uncover how these processes influence trait evolution and ecological specialization across diverse taxa.
				</p>
				<p>Using advanced techniques such as <strong>geometric morphometrics</strong>, <strong>3D modeling (photogrammetry)</strong>, and <strong>phylogenetic comparative methods</strong>, I investigate the interplay between form and function in evolutionary biology. I focus on how evolutionary pressures, such as size reduction or changes in ecological roles, drive the integration of morphological traits and impact broader evolutionary patterns.</p>
				<p>Additionally, I am committed to making these computational tools and methodologies accessible to researchers and educators through open-source platforms, promoting a more inclusive and innovative approach to studying evolutionary biology.</p>
