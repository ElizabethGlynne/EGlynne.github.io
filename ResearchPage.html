              I am currently a PhD candidate in Evolutionary Biology at Iowa State University, working under the guidance of 
              <a href="https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/dcadams/" target="_blank">Dr. Dean C. Adams</a>. My research focuses on understanding the morphological consequences of evolutionary change, specifically in geckos. I leverage advanced techniques such as geometric morphometrics, 3D modeling (photogrammetry), and phylogenetic comparative methods to explore these complex evolutionary processes.

            <p>
              My research has explored various themes, including the evolution of novel traits, the evolution of sexual size dimorphism among closely related groups, and how miniaturization, or the evolution of extremely small body sizes, influences morphological integration. Through these studies, I aim to uncover how evolutionary processes shape morphological diversity and the functional roles these traits play.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In addition to my doctoral work, I am deeply involved in expanding the application of 3D photogrammetry and computational methods in evolutionary biology. I strive to make these tools more accessible and effective for both research and education, bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical application. My work involves developing pipelines that utilize freeware and open-source platforms, ensuring that these advanced methodologies are available to researchers and educators worldwide, regardless of their resources.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              My commitment extends beyond advancing our understanding of evolution; it also focuses on refining and democratizing the tools and techniques used in our field. By improving methodologies, I aim to enhance our ability to explore and visualize biological diversity in greater detail—from macroevolutionary patterns to micro-scale morphological changes—ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive and inclusive understanding of the natural world.
