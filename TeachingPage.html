                As an educator, I strive to create an inclusive and engaging learning environment that fosters curiosity, critical thinking, and a passion for discovery. I view the neurodiversity of my students as a form of biodiversity, recognizing that each individual brings valuable perspectives and ideas to the classroom. My teaching philosophy emphasizes the importance of adapting to diverse learning styles and experiences, empowering every student to thrive.

            <p>
                I incorporate various instructional methods, including experiential learning, student-centered activities, and interactive discussions, to encourage active participation and enhance understanding. My approach is rooted in building a collaborative and supportive classroom atmosphere where students feel confident to explore new ideas, ask questions, and develop essential academic and professional skills. Through my experience as an Instructor of Record and laboratory instructor, Iâ€™ve honed my ability to connect theoretical concepts with real-world applications, making science both accessible and relevant to all learners.
