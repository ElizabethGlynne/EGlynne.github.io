            <p>As an educator, I strive to create an inclusive and engaging learning environment that fosters curiosity, critical thinking, and a passion for discovery among my students. I believe that the neurodiversity seen in our students is a form of biodiversity, and that every student has the potential to contribute valuable perspectives and ideas to the classroom. My teaching philosophy emphasizes adapting to diverse learning styles and experiences, allowing each student to thrive. I incorporate various instructional methods, including experiential learning, student-centered activities, and interactive discussions, to encourage active participation and enhance understanding.</p>
            <p>Through my experience as an Instructor of Record and laboratory instructor, I have honed my ability to connect theoretical concepts with real-world applications, making science accessible and relevant to all learners.</p>
