		<p>I am a curious and passionate individual who values creativity, inclusivity, and lifelong learning. My journey into evolutionary biology was unconventional; initially a psychology major, I didnâ€™t learn about evolution until I was 23 years old! This discovery sparked a deep fascination with the mechanisms of life and led me to shift my focus toward understanding biological diversity and evolutionary processes.</p>
		<p>In my personal life, I have taken on caregiving roles that have taught me invaluable lessons in empathy, patience, and resilience. These experiences have shaped my approach to both my professional work and my interactions with others, reinforcing my belief in the importance of communication, trust, and respect in <b>all</b> relationships. I firmly believe that there is always a solution if we are creative enough, and this mindset drives me to approach challenges with optimism and innovation.</p>
		<p>As a foster and adoptive parent and dog mom, I am deeply committed to caring for others and creating inclusive spaces where everyone feels valued. I find joy in exploring the natural world, hiking in scenic landscapes, immersing myself in books that stretch the imagination, or enjoying a good conversation with great company. I also love the creative process of cooking, where I apply my scientific curiosity and intuitive sense to experiment with new flavors and techniques, often with the kids by my side. I thrive in dynamic settings where curiosity is encouraged, and where I can continuously learn and grow as both a scientist and a person.</p>
